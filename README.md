# Text Autocomplete Web App
This is a simple web application built with Flask that provides word autocomplete functionality using a Trie data structure.
Users can also add new words to the dictionary, which will be saved persistently in a dictionary.txt file.

## Features

âž• Add new words dynamically
ðŸ’¾ Persist new words to a file (dictionary.txt)
ðŸ§  Fast lookup using Trie structure
